			<h1>Hi, I am Fatima Diaz- Welcome to BeBioinformatician!!</h1>
			<p>
			BeBioinformatician is my personal bridge between curiosity and capability: a practical blog about building the skills to become a bioinformatician.
			</p>
			<p>
			It grew out of my own journey — learning by doing, making mistakes, and gradually turning tools, theory, and real projects into confidence.
</p>
			
			<p>
			Here you’ll find posts, notes, and project write-ups on bioinformatics, data science in healthcare, multi-omics, and AI in cancer research — always with a hands-on, reproducible mindset.
